 "\tWhy study probability? All around us is uncertainty and we must \
understand its nature in order to conduct ourselves in the world. We join the \
shortest waiting line in hopes that it has the best chance of allowing us to \
be served quickly.  We invest our savings in assets that we believe are most \
likely to yield high returns.  We buy the battery that we think is most \
likely to last the longest.  The study of probability also lets you \
understand the mechanics of games of chance like roulette, poker, and \
blackjack; what is predictable and what is not, what to bet on (usually \
nothing) and what not to bet on (usually everything).  In all of these cases \
we do not know for certain what will happen before the phenomenon is observed \
(we don't know how much time we will wait in line, what our opponent's \
blackjack hand will be, etc.).  But some common-sense assumptions, background \
knowledge, or a long history of observed data from similar experiments can \
enable us to quantify likelihoods.  Several of these examples have actually \
given birth to significant subfields of probability or related areas of \
study, for example, queueing theory (i.e., the study of waiting lines) and \
mathematical finance, which are introduced in Chapter 6.   Probability also \
provides the theoretical basis for statistics, which is the art of using data \
obtained randomly to draw conclusions about social and scientific phenomena. \
\n\tIn addition to all this, probability exhibits many of the aesthetically \
appealing properties that attract people to mathematics in general. It \
proceeds logically from a few simple axioms to build an abstract structure \
which is straightforward, yet powerful. The cast of characters of probability \
is both foreign and tangible, which implies that you must work a little to \
get to know them, but there is hope in succeeding in the acquaintance.\n\t\
This text will be somewhat different from others in the field. While the main \
ideas of probability have not changed much in at least fifty years, the world \
has, and learning in mathematics has changed with it.  Many things are \
technologically possible today of which mathematics education should take \
advantage.  This book is a living, interactive text which asks you to do \
activities as you read carefully to help you understand and discover the \
ideas of probability in new ways, on your own terms.  The complete text is \
available electronically in the form of ",
 StyleBox["Mathematica",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " notebooks, one for each section.  The notebooks are executable, so that \
you can reenter existing commands, modify them, or write your own \
supplemental commands to take the study in the direction you wish. You will \
be building probability yourself in a kind of workshop, with ",
 StyleBox["Mathematica",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " and your own insight and love of experimentation as your most powerful \
tools.  I caution you against depending too much on the machine, however.  \
Much of the time, traditional pencil, paper, and brainpower are what you need \
most to learn.  What the computer does, however, is open up new problems, or \
let you get new insights into concepts.  So we will be judiciously blending \
new technology with traditionally successful pedagogy to enable you to learn \
effectively.  Consistent themes will be the idea of taking a sample randomly \
from a larger universe of objects in order to get information about that \
universe, and the computer simulation of random phenomena to observe patterns \
in many replications that speak to the properties of the phenomena. \n\tThe \
cast of characters in probability whose personalities we will explore in \
depth in the coming chapters include the following six principal players: (1) \
Event; (2) Sample Space; (3) Probability Measure; (4) Random Variable; (5) \
Distribution; and (6) Expectation.  The rest of this section will be a brief \
intuitive introduction to these six. \n\tMost of the time we are interested \
in assessing likelihoods of ",
 StyleBox["events",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", that is, things that we might observe as we watch a phenomenon happen. \
The event that a national chain's bid to acquire a local grocery store is \
successful, the event that at least 10 patients arrive to an emergency room \
between 6:00 and 7:00 AM, the event that a hand of five poker cards forms a \
straight, the event that we hold the winning ticket in the lottery, and the \
event that two particular candidates among several are selected for jury duty \
are just a few examples. They share the characteristic that there is some \
uncertain experiment, sampling process, or phenomenon whose result we do not \
know \"now\". But there is a theoretical \"later\" at which we can observe \
the phenomenon taking place, and decide whether the event did or didn't \
occur.\n\tAn ",

 StyleBox["composite event",

For instance the event that we are dealt a poker hand that makes up a \
straight is composite because it consists of many outcomes which completely \
specify the hand, such as 2 through 6 of hearts, 10 through ace of clubs, \
etc. ",
 "\n",
 "\tThis is where the ",
 StyleBox["sample space",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " makes its entry: the sample space is the collection of all possible \
outcomes of the experiment or phenomenon, that is all possible indecomposable \
results that could happen.  For the poker hand example, the sample space \
would consist of all possible five-card hands. In specifying sample spaces, \
we must be clear about assumptions; for instance we might assume that the \
order in which the cards were dealt does not matter, and we cannot receive \
the same card twice, so that the cards are dealt without replacement."

	The CD that accompanies this book contains a Mathematica notebook for each text section. Copyright law forbids you from distributing these notebooks without the express permission of the publisher, just as with the print version. The print text was made without color, by publisher specification, but color effects are included into the electronic version. Otherwise the electronic notebooks are identical to the print version.  When a notebook is first loaded you can select the Evaluate Initialization Cells command under the Evaluation menu to reproduce the output.  The look of the notebooks in the front end will depend on what style sheet you are using; I have applied the Book/Textbook stylesheet to these files.
	Also on the disk are two packages: the KnoxProb7¾Utilities¾ package for users of version 7 of Mathematica, and KnoxProb6`Utilities` for users of version 6.  Move the appropriate folder into the AddOns\ExtraPackages subdirectory of your main Mathematica directory in order to allow the electronic book to run.  The electronic files are written for version 7, so the Needs commands in the notebooks should be modified to load KnoxProb6`Utilities` instead of KnoxProb7`Utiilities` for Mathematica 6 users. The main differences between the two Utilities versions are: (1) the Histogram command that I had written for the version 6 package is eliminated in the version 7 package because Wolfram Research included its own suitable Histogram command into the kernel in version 7; and (2) the ProbabilityHistogram command had to be rewritten for version 7 due to the elimination of the BarCharts package that it had relied on. Both packages are updates of those in the KnoxProb`Utilities` package that was available for the first edition of the book, adapting to the major changes in the structure of Mathematica that happened as it went into version 6.0.  Among the most important changes for our purposes was that many statistical commands that had previously been contained in external packages were moved into the kernel, so that these packages no longer needed to be loaded. The electronic book has been subjected to a lot of testing, and it should operate well.

 "\tThe basic facts, concepts, and computational methods of probability have \
mostly been covered in Chapters 1 to 4.   This short chapter will attempt to \
set a context for our subject, by using the two most important theorems of \
probability, the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem, as \
rallying points around which we study historical development.  The final \
chapter will continue the process of context development in a different way, \
by examining several problem areas in applied mathematics that arose mostly \
in the latter part of the ",
 Cell[BoxData[
  FormBox[
   SuperscriptBox["20", "th"], TraditionalForm]]],
 " century, in which probability has taken a central place.  Because our \
focus is on history and context rather than the development of new problem \
solving techniques, this chapter will be discursive and will have very few \
exercises.  Yet it is an important one for you to read to complete your \
understanding.  \n\tThe source material in this chapter comes from several \
places: some is just part of the oral tradition, and other information has \
come from some useful sources cited in the bibliography: Burton, Cooke, \
Hacking, Katz, and the fine probability book by Snell.\n\tOne might say that \
probability has always been with us, because humankind has always been \
engaged in games of chance involving dice, cards, and other media.  According \
to Burton (p. 415), archaeological digs of prehistoric sites frequently \
produce examples of forerunners of today's dice called ",
 StyleBox["astraguli",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", which are made from the tarsal bones of hooved animals.  There is \
evidence in Egypt reaching as far back as 3500 B.C. that people played a \
board game called \"Hounds and Jackals\" using these astraguli.  Dice in \
today's form seem to have been with us since at least the early Roman empire. \
 There and elsewhere gambling became such a problem that the authorities \
moved to limit or outlaw it, to little avail.  Card playing was introduced \
into Europe by contact with Eastern civilizations: Chinese, Indian, and also \
Egyptian, and by the 1300's it had become very popular.  In fact, according \
to Burton again (p. 417), after Johann Gutenberg printed his famous Bible in \
1440, he immediately went to work printing cards.  \n\tFinancial problems \
involving insurance, investment, and mortality also arose early in Western \
history, as the merchant class developed.  Among the earliest and most common \
such problems was the practice adopted by communities of raising public money \
by borrowing lump sums from individuals, then agreeing to pay a lifetime \
annuity to the lender.  In light of the importance of the problem, and its \
dependence on knowing the likelihoods that the lender dies in a given amount \
of time, it is strange that a theory of probability did not come about \
earlier than it did.  These communities tended not to play the insurance game \
very well.\n\tThe mathematician Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576) was one of the \
earliest to study problems of probability.  Cardano was a brilliant and \
eccentric character: an astrologer, physician, and mathematician, who became \
Rector of the University of Padua.  He did early work on the solution of the \
general cubic equation, and was involved in a dispute over what part was \
actually his work.  But for us it is most interesting that he wrote a work \
called ",
 StyleBox["Liber de ludo",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", or ",
 StyleBox["Book on Gambling",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", in which among other things he introduced the idea of characterizing the \
probability of an event as a number ",
 StyleBox["p",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " between 0 and 1, showed understanding in the context of dice of the \
theoretical concept of equiprobable outcomes, and anticipated that if the \
probability of an event is ",
 StyleBox["p",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " and you perform the experiment a large number of times ",
 StyleBox["n",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", then the event will occur about ",
 StyleBox["n p",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " times.  Thus, he predicted important results about binomial expectation \
and limiting probabilities that were more fully developed by others much \
later.  But ",
 StyleBox["Book on Gambling",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " was only published posthumously in 1663, by which time another very \
important event had already happened.  \n\tIt is widely acknowledged that \
there is a specific time and place where probability as a well-defined \
mathematical area was born.  Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a prodigy who at \
the age of 12 mastered Euclid's ",
 StyleBox["Elements",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ".  He was never in great health and died at the age of 39, but before that \
he gained acclaim not only as a mathematician, but as an experimental \
physicist, religious philosopher, and activist.  In 1654 he began a \
correspondence with the great mathematician Pierre DeFermat (1601-1665) from \
which probability theory came.  In those days in France, it was common for \
noblemen to dabble in academic matters as a part of their social duties and \
pleasures.  One Antoine Gombaud, the Chevalier de M\[EAcute]r\[EAcute], was \
such a person.  He was acquainted with Pascal and many other intellectuals of \
his day, and he enjoyed dicing.  The problem he posed to Pascal was how to \
fairly divide the stakes in a game which is terminated prematurely.  For \
instance, if a player has bet that a six will appear in eight rolls of a fair \
die, but the game is ended after three unsuccessful trials, how much should \
each player take away from the total stake?  Pascal reported this to Fermat, \
and their interaction shows a clear understanding of repeated independent \
trials, and the difference between conditional and unconditional probability. \
 Pascal reasoned that the probability of winning on throw ",
 StyleBox["i",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " is ",

 Cell[BoxData[

 " gives the total probability ",

  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " to the bettor under concern and ",
 Cell[BoxData[
  FormBox[
   RowBox[{"1", "-", "p"}], TraditionalForm]]],
 " to the other.  But Fermat responded that this analysis is only correct if \
you do not know the outcome of the first three rolls.  If you do, then the \
chance that the bettor wins on the next roll is 1/6 (note this is a \
conditional probability), so that the bettor should take 1/6 of the stake in \
exchange for quitting at trial 4, in fact at any trial.  Pascal was happy \
with Fermat's analysis.  Later on as they studied independent trials \
problems, they both noticed the importance of the binomial coefficient ",

 " (not written in this notation in those days) to the computation of \
probabilities involving independent trials.  It should be added, though \
(Cooke (p. 201)), that combinatorics itself had its origin long before.  At \
least as early as 300 B.C., Hindu scholars were asking such questions as how \
many philosophical systems can be formed by taking a certain number of \
doctrines from a larger list of doctrines, which is clearly our basic problem \
of sampling without order or replacement.  \n\tThe second half of the \
seventeenth century was a very fertile one for probability, as many of the \
most famous mathematicians and scientists were making contributions.  \
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) was a great Dutch scholar who wrote the first \
book on probability: ",
 StyleBox["De ratiociniis in ludo aleae",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", or ",
 StyleBox["On Reasoning in a Dice Game",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " that compiled and extended the results of Pascal and Fermat.  In \
particular, Huygens developed ways to compute multinomial probabilities, and \
crystallized the idea of expectation of a game.  But it was James Bernoulli \
(1654-1705) who wrote the seminal work ",
 StyleBox["Ars Conjectandi",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " or ",
 StyleBox["The Art of Conjecturing",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", released after his death in 1713, whose work would set new directions for \
the burgeoning subject.  In ",
 StyleBox["The Art of Conjecturing",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 ", Bernoulli set down the combinatorial underpinnings of probability in much \
the form as they exist today.  He is not the original source of most of these \
results, as previously mentioned, and probably benefited in this regard by \
the work of his mentor Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716), who made \
contributions to combinatorics as well as co-inventing calculus.  But the \
most important result to the development of probability was Bernoulli's proof \
of a special case of the theorem that we now describe.\n\tProbability would \
never be able to have a firm foundation without an unambiguous and \
well-accepted definition of the probability of an event.  And, this \
probability ought to have meaningful predictive value for future performances \
of the experiment to which the event pertains.  One needs to know that in \
many repetitions of the experiment, the proportion of the time that the event \
occurs converges to the probability of the event.  This is the Law of Large \
Numbers (a phrase coined by Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840) for whom the \
Poisson distribution is named).  \n\tThe Law of Large Numbers actually takes \
two forms, one called the ",
 StyleBox["Weak Law",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
 " and the other called the ",
 StyleBox["Strong Law",
  FontSlant->"Italic"],
